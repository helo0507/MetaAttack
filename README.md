MetaAttack is a research project focused on inaudible attacks using ultrasonic waves.

The code in this project primarily introduces a feedback algorithm for MetaAttack, which helps attackers determine whether the attack was successful.

Simply run the feedback algorithm by entering through test.py.

The feedback code needs to be used in conjunction with iwlist (https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man8/iwlist.8.html).

The 'aplay' command in the feedback code needs to be changed to the port of the sound card on your own device.

The path to the audio attack file needs to be changed after the 'aplay' command.

To achieve optimal attack performance, this algorithm should be used in conjunction with the attack device described in the paper.
